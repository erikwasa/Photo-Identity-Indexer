## Current focus

WI-0182 / issue #490: PR #509 implements the evaluation-only technical-quality harness over durable review proxies. It adds versioned raw sharpness/exposure/clipping/contrast/resolution evidence, q78 profile-gated candidate reasons, deterministic PostgreSQL proxy sampling, private JSON review export, timing/storage measurements and synthetic analyzer coverage. No collection semantics or catalogue quality persistence are introduced. Keep WI-0182 in review until representative private-archive review/runtime evidence is recorded.

WI-0186 / issue #512: PR #515 scopes Visual/Caption/Combined search through an optional saved Smart Collection without weakening exact Smart Collection semantics. The server resolves one eligibility set, applies it before semantic top-k and inside caption SQL, and keeps explicit saved search-result collections immutable. Keep WI-0186 in review until maintained-archive relevance, latency and restart/membership verification is recorded.

M30 video support remains intentionally deferred and blocked until explicit maintainer reactivation.

## Maintainer acceptance — 2026-10-04 (Europe/Stockholm)

The maintainer completed the current maintained UI review batch:

- WI-0165 is accepted after PR #505; slideshow counts, player-triggered **Prepared** continuity, reload/revalidation restoration and stale-state behavior work as expected.
- WI-0178 is accepted after PR #501; the maintained desktop and phone/PWA slideshow-library search/filter experience works as expected.
- WI-0185 is accepted after PRs #506, #507 and #508; the date-only audit filters and the remaining cross-person assignment audit workflow work as expected.

WI-0165, WI-0178 and WI-0185 are completed. M35 is completed. Issues #499 and #503 are resolved; issue #481 was already closed by PR #501 and now has maintained acceptance evidence.

The maintainer previously accepted WI-0163, WI-0167, WI-0169, WI-0170, WI-0171, WI-0172, WI-0173, WI-0175, WI-0176, WI-0177, WI-0179, WI-0180, WI-0181, WI-0183 and WI-0184.

## Next concrete step

For WI-0186, after PR #515 is merged/rebuilt, verify representative person/activity and date/place/scene scoped searches, include a scope with missing captions, record small/large-scope latency, and confirm a saved scoped result retains exact ordered membership after restart. WI-0182 separately still needs its representative private photo-quality review/runtime evidence. M30 video support remains deferred.
