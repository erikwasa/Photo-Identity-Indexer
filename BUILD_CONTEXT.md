## Current focus

WI-0182 / issue #490: PR #509 implements the evaluation-only technical-quality harness over durable review proxies. It adds versioned raw sharpness/exposure/clipping/contrast/resolution evidence, q78 profile-gated candidate reasons, deterministic PostgreSQL proxy sampling, private JSON review export, timing/storage measurements and synthetic analyzer coverage. No collection semantics or catalogue quality persistence are introduced. Keep WI-0182 in review until representative private-archive review/runtime evidence is recorded.

WI-0186 / issue #512: PR #515 scopes Visual/Caption/Combined search through an optional saved Smart Collection without weakening exact Smart Collection semantics. The server resolves one eligibility set, applies it before semantic top-k and inside caption SQL, and keeps explicit saved search-result collections immutable. PR #517 corrected the large-scope PostgreSQL timeout. The 2026-10-13 maintainer retest succeeded for Fideli (5,638 eligible) in all three modes and Mor och Dotter (1,057 eligible); provenance badges behave as expected. Keep WI-0186 in review until independent exact-membership and saved-list restart verification is recorded.

WI-0187 / issue #513: PR #516 lets Creative Collections use either the existing exact Smart Collection anchor or a versioned ranked Search anchor with Visual/Caption/Combined mode, optional Smart scope and bounded top-N admission. Search anchor materialization reuses WI-0186 retrieval, then enters the existing one-level moment/context and deterministic Creative selection pipeline. The maintainer now reports the search-anchor workflow works as expected. Keep WI-0187 in review pending the specific two-recipe, legacy compatibility and snapshot-immutability evidence in its acceptance criteria.

M30: WI-0150 completed, ADR-0012 accepted, and WI-0151 in progress. The maintainer's 2026-10-15 pilot verified 25 locally available videos (1,284 online-only untouched), 16 correct SDR posters across H.264/HEVC Main and 9 deliberately deferred HEVC Main 10 HLG clips, zero reported failures and no unexpected hydration. Anonymous evidence is documented in docs/operations/video-pilot-evidence-2026-10-15.md. Checkpoint 2 adds PostgreSQL v33 photo-default media-kind and revision-bound video metadata/poster schema with isolation tests. The CLI remains isolated: no automatic video writes, no gallery cards, and no photo-only query changes yet.

## Maintainer acceptance — 2026-10-04 (Europe/Stockholm)

The maintainer completed the current maintained UI review batch:

- WI-0165 is accepted after PR #505; slideshow counts, player-triggered **Prepared** continuity, reload/revalidation restoration and stale-state behavior work as expected.
- WI-0178 is accepted after PR #501; the maintained desktop and phone/PWA slideshow-library search/filter experience works as expected.
- WI-0185 is accepted after PRs #506, #507 and #508; the date-only audit filters and the remaining cross-person assignment audit workflow work as expected.

WI-0165, WI-0178 and WI-0185 are completed. M35 is completed. Issues #499 and #503 are resolved; issue #481 was already closed by PR #501 and now has maintained acceptance evidence.

The maintainer previously accepted WI-0163, WI-0167, WI-0169, WI-0170, WI-0171, WI-0172, WI-0173, WI-0175, WI-0176, WI-0177, WI-0179, WI-0180, WI-0181, WI-0183 and WI-0184.

## Next concrete step

WI-0151: opt-in video metadata, revision-bound Rec.709 posters, exclusion-safe publication, poster cleanup and purge manifest are merged. The current checkpoint adds a default-off, separate read-only video library and checksum-verified poster delivery, with source-row authorization locks and current-revision/exclusion gating. Next: HDR policy/quality tests, remaining photo-only query isolation audit and consolidated maintained-photo/video manual acceptance. No automatic video worker, playback proxy, photo search or slideshow video inclusion.
