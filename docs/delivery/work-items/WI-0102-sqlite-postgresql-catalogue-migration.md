# WI-0102: Migrate the existing SQLite catalogue and perform controlled PostgreSQL cutover

## Objective
Provide a repeatable, verifiable migration of the maintainer's existing catalogue to PostgreSQL with a safe rollback boundary.

## In scope
- Build a migration/import command that reads SQLite and writes a fresh compatible PostgreSQL catalogue.
- Preserve stable GUID/integer identities, timestamps, hashes, review/identity history, processing state and relationships.
- Define ordering for identity/sequence values and validate generated-key continuation after import.
- Validate row counts plus critical domain invariants and PostgreSQL foreign keys before cutover.
- Require the source SQLite catalogue to be quiesced/read-only during final migration.
- Keep a timestamped backup/read-only SQLite copy until maintainer acceptance.
- Provide explicit cutover and rollback instructions; never run two writable authoritative catalogues.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Migration is repeatable from the same SQLite backup into an empty PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] Critical table/entity counts and referential/domain invariants pass before application startup.
- [ ] Review history, identities, tags/Places, smart collections and processing state survive representative verification.
- [ ] New inserts after migration do not collide with imported integer sequences.
- [ ] Cutover selects exactly one authoritative writable database.
- [ ] Rollback can restore the pre-cutover SQLite application state without modifying the preserved backup.
