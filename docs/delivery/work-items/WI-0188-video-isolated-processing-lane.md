# WI-0188: Introduce an opt-in, isolated video processing lane

## Objective

Schedule on-demand heavy video jobs without disrupting ordinary photo ingestion, recognition, captioning, search or slideshow use.

## In scope

- Default-off video enablement and separate visible queue for selected videos; existing photo workflows never silently queue full-video processing.
- Limits for concurrent video jobs, CPU/GPU/IO, memory, hydrated source bytes/time, derived frames and local disk; photo work has priority and can pause video processing.
- Cancellation, progress, restart/retry, bounded temp-file cleanup and resumable/idempotent work; avoid stale partial results.
- Revision/model/preset/policy version identifiers; invalidate evidence after source change or exclusion while keeping originals immutable.
- Explicit pause/stop, operator-visible failure diagnostics and aggregate resource metrics without logging personal media contents or paths.

## Out of scope

Proxy format implementation, caption/embedding inference, face assignment, cloud workers or a replacement photo-job framework.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Video processing is off by default after upgrade and only runs when enabled and selected.
- [ ] Concurrent photo/video benchmark records photo job throughput and search/slideshow latency against a photo-only baseline with WI-0150-agreed bounds.
- [ ] Restart, cancellation, exclusions, online-only files and malformed video cannot leak partial derivatives or unlimited hydrated files.
- [ ] Work is independently pausable/observable and obeys configurable concurrency/resource limits.

## Verification requirements

Deterministic job lifecycle tests, plus real mixed-load CPU/GPU/IO and photo regression measurements.

## Implementation checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1 — admission/identity contracts (2026-10-19, implementation in progress)

- Added `VideoDerivativeJobIdentity` in Core: stable SHA-256 job key binds exact
  asset revision, derivative kind, policy version, output preset and operator-supplied
  local executable SHA-256. There are no private source names or paths in the key.
- Added `VideoProcessingBudget`, `VideoProcessingCandidate`,
  `VideoProcessingActivity` and the fail-closed, deterministic
  `VideoProcessingAdmissionPolicy`. Defaults are **disabled and paused**.
  Admission refuses stale/excluded/unsupported/online-only material, photo-busy
  periods, or resource estimates outside frame/source/temp/concurrency limits.
- Unit tests cover all denial reasons, safe default, budgets, validation and
  derivative idempotency/invalidation dimensions. No worker is connected and
  no queue or media processing runs because of this change.
- This is policy **preflight only**, not a security lease or resource-enforcing
  process supervisor. A caller must re-check revision, exclusion and source
  availability under authoritative repository locks and protect original bytes
  before execution. Maximum job lifetime still needs enforcement by the worker.

**Remaining work before WI-0188 review:** durable PostgreSQL job and control
records, atomic lease/restart/retry with cancellation and stale-output fencing;
strict local-process and hydration budgets; worker photo-priority/pause and
operator progress/diagnostics; default-off API wiring; atomic temp cleanup,
exclusion tests and maintained Windows mixed-load measurements. No existing
acceptance criterion is considered met solely by checkpoint 1.

## Completion notes

- Files changed: Core policy/identity contracts and unit tests; delivery tracking.
- Trade-offs: explicit conservative admission contract before persistent state and
  backend execution; no speculative API, schema upgrade or FFmpeg invocation.
- Deferred work: durable runner, database migration, media adapters,
  observability, mixed-load benchmark and maintained-host signoff.
- Commands run: no local .NET runtime available in the connected execution
  environment; run targeted Core tests and Docs validation through CI after PR.
